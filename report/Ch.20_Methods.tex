\section{Data}
\citep{patel2025loan} provides a dataset of loan applications from the US and Canada, which we use to evaluate fairness in machine learning models. The dataset includes features such as applicant income, credit score, and loan amount, along with a binary target variable indicating whether the loan was approved.

\section{Base Model Training}
We trained two base models being a Random Forest and a Neural Network.
