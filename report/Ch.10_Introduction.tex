\chapter{Project Idea\label{Idea}}
The idea of this project is to explore the concept of fairness in machine learning models. For that we chose a dataset of credit loan applications and their outcomes. The goal was to train normal machine learning models on this dataset and evaluate it regarding a chosen fairness metric. After that we looked into methods of mitigating unfairness and implemented one of those methods ourselves. This was then evaluated again regarding the fairness metric and compared to the initial results. Further we analyzed the trade-off between fairness and accuracy that comes with these methods and did a grid search on some hyperparameters to find the best possible solution for our project.
